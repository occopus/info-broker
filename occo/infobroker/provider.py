""" Information System for OCCO.

.. moduleauthor:: Adam Visegradi <adam.visegradi@sztaki.mta.hu>

This module contains the primitive components of the OCCO Information Broker
Service.

The base idea is that the Information Broker is defined as a simple interface
(:class:`InfoProvider`) of whose main feature is that information is queried by
*key*\ s (see :meth:`InfoProvider.get`). The Information Broker can be
partitioned on the keyspace, ideally to form semantically closed modules.

These modules can then be congregated into a hierarchy using the
:class:`InfoRouter`, which hierarchy can then be split along any edge to become
a distributed architecture of information provider components. These components
can communicate through RPC calls (see :ref:`comm`), which is hidden behind an
:class:`RemoteInfoProvider` stub.

    """Abstract implementation of an information provider.

    Sub-classes must be decorated with :func:`@provider <provider>`, and
    provider methods must be marked with the :func:`@provides <provides>`
    decorator. These methods will then be stored in the class object, in a
    lookup table.

    The ``InfoProvider`` uses this lookup table to decide whether it can handle
    a specific request, and to perform it if it can.

    Trivial context management (i.e.: it does nothing) is supported by the
    InfoProvider to be forward-compatible with actual information providers
    that use resources.

    .. _ibsplit:

    .. todo:: Currently, the InfoBroker can only be split over the keyspace. It
        would be possible to be split over argument-space too. This would allow
        us to distribute the InfoBroker in such a way that, e.g., one could be
        placed physically near one backend, while another, supporting the same
        keys, can be placed near another. E.g.: one handling node.status
        queries for one cloud, and one for another.

        Implementation:
          - Pass ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` through can_get.
          - This way, it can be overridden in a derived class so the arguments
            are also used.
          - It may also be possible to attach ``can_get`` overrides to specific
            ``get`` methods. ``can_get`` would check whether there is a method
            available for that key (as it does now), and *then* it could ask
            this specific ``get`` function if it wants to override ``can_get``.
            E.g., like properties:

            .. code:: python

                @provider
                class EG_Provider(InfoProvider):

                    @provides('mykey')
                    def acquire_mykey(arg1, arg2):
                        ...

                    # This registers this override so can_get() can use it:
                    @acquire_mykey.override_check
                    def check_mykey(arg1, arg2):
                        return True if canhandle_arg1_arg2 else False

    .. todo:: In case of :class:`InfoRouter` and
        :class:`~occo.infobroker.remote.RemoteInfoProviderStub`, it may be
        desirable to cache whether the object itself, and/or a specific
        sub-provider can handle a specific key. This would reduce communication
        overhead a lot in case of remote querying.

        However, this would interfere with the :ref:`other to-do <ibsplit>`
        (argument-space changes over time, which interferes with caching), and
        also makes modifying the system a bit more difficult (a changed remote
        module may support new keys).

        Cache-timeout would help, but it would mean a delay in "can-get"
        information being distributed up the chain.

        Another solution would be communication back-links, and an explicit
        ``invalidate_cache`` method. This method would notify all clients
        through its back-links to invalidate their caches, which would, in turn,
        notify their back-links, etc.
